# Data Science Job Salaries


## Explications et Instructions

This repository contains the code for my project **Data Science Job Salaries**

## Presentation

If data professions occupy an increasingly important place in companies, it is often said that they offer an interesting remuneration. But as in any industry, some professions pay more than others.

The dataset we are going to work on allows us to explore the salaries of all the data professions according to several criteria such as the position, the country, the years of experience of the worker or the size of the company.

In our study, it will be interesting to understand how salaries behave, how they evolve, and to compare these behaviors across countries; we will also be able to develop a predictive model.
